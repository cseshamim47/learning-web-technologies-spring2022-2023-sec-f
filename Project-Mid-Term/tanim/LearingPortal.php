        </header>
        <p>Bitcoin is a digital currency that was created in 2009. It operates on a decentralized network, which means that it is not controlled by any government or financial institution. Bitcoin can be used to purchase goods and services online, or it can be traded for other currencies.</p>

          <h1>How does Bitcoin work?</h1>
        </header>
        <p>Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain. When someone makes a transaction using Bitcoin, it is verified by a network of computers around the world. Once the transaction is verified, it is added to the blockchain and cannot be altered.</p>

          <h1>Is Bitcoin anonymous?</h1>
        </header>
        <p>Bitcoin transactions are not completely anonymous, as each transaction is recorded on the blockchain. However, users can create new Bitcoin addresses for each transaction they make, which can make it more difficult to trace their activity. Additionally, there are certain privacy-focused cryptocurrencies that offer greater anonymity than Bitcoin.</p>
